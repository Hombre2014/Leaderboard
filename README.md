# Yuriy Chamkoriyski Leaderboard project

> JavaScript leaderboard project using API.

![screenshot](./leaderboard.png)

## Description

In this activity I will set up a JavaScript project for the Leaderboard list app, using webpack and ES6 features, notably modules. I should develop a first working version of the app following a wire frame, but without styling - just focus on functionality. In following activities, I will consume the Leaderboard API using JavaScript async and await and add some styling.

## Instructions:

- Use [Gitflow](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/articles/gitflow.md)
- Create an npm project with [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/guides/output-management/#setting-up-htmlwebpackplugin)
- Write plain HTML markup with minimum styling (just to make the layout), because you will implement styles in the following steps
- Don't make API calls (you'll do it in a following lesson).
- Use ES6 modules, with import and export.

## Built With
